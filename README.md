# 🐍 Python With Corey Schafer - Learning Series by Rahul Shirke

Welcome to the **Python With Corey Schafer** GitHub repository!

This repo is a well-organized series of **Python learning notes**, directly inspired by the legendary [Corey Schafer's Python tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/c/Coreyms). As a student and developer, I (Rahul Shirke) have personally watched and studied each episode and documented my learnings here with clean examples and explanations.

## 📚 What You'll Learn

This series covers Python from beginner to intermediate/advanced level. Each folder is named according to the episode and contains:

- 📝 A detailed **Markdown (`.md`) file** with well-structured notes.
- 🧪 **Code examples** (`.py`) explained step-by-step.
- 🔗 References to video links and topics covered.

### ✅ Topics Covered So Far:

- Episode 1: Introduction & Setup  
- Episode 2: Variables and Strings  
- Episode 3: Lists, Tuples, and Sets  
- Episode 4: Dictionaries  
- Episode 5: Conditional Statements  
- Episode 6: Loops and Iterations  
- Episode 7: Functions  
- Episode 8: Modules and Standard Library  
...and more to come!

> 📌 Each topic is broken down into subfolders for clarity and hands-on practice.

## 🧠 Learning Process

Here's how I approached this learning journey:

1. **Watch** the video from Corey Schafer's YouTube channel.
2. **Code along** to understand the logic and flow.
3. **Document** all notes in simple language with examples.
4. **Practice** by tweaking examples and building mini-projects.
5. **Organize** the folder structure so anyone can follow the same path.

This repository is a reflection of **learning by doing** — one of the best ways to truly understand Python.
