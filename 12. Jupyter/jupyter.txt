🧠 What is Jupyter?
Jupyter Notebook is an interactive web-based environment where you can:
Write and run Python code (and other languages too)
Visualize data (plots, tables)
Add markdown notes (headings, bullet points, equations, etc.)
Mix code and rich text in one document

It’s especially useful for:
Data analysis
Machine learning experiments
Teaching and documentation



step to work on Jupyter:

🚀 Step 1: Install Jupyter Notebook
If you're using Anaconda (recommended), Jupyter is already included.

Otherwise, install using pip:
pip install notebook


⚙️ Step 2: Launch Jupyter
From the terminal or Anaconda Prompt:
jupyter notebook
This opens Jupyter in your browser at http://localhost:8888.


📝 Step 3: Create Your First Notebook
1. Click "New" → Python 3 (ipykernel).
2. You’ll see a notebook interface with cells.
▶️ Types of Cells:
    Code cell: For writing Python code
    Markdown cell: For notes, headings, links, etc.
    Switch cell type from the dropdown or using:
    Esc + M → Markdown
    Esc + Y → Code

✅ Step 4: Run Code
Type in a code cell:
print("Hello, Jupyter!")

Run it with:
Shift + Enter


🖋️ Step 5: Markdown Example
In a Markdown cell:
# This is a heading
## This is a sub-heading
- Bullet 1
- Bullet 2

**Bold Text**
_Italic Text_

`inline code`

```python
# code block
print("Hello!")
```


📊 Step 6: Plotting Example
Make sure `matplotlib` is installed:
pip install matplotlib

Then in a notebook cell:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
y = [10, 20, 25, 30]

plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title("Simple Line Plot")
plt.show()


💾 Step 7: Save and Export
    Save your work: File → Save and Checkpoint
    Export as PDF, HTML, etc.: File → Download As
